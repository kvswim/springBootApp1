Definition of a REST call:
    From late 90s-late 00s, webapps used ASP and JSP. Quickly turns into unmaintainable spaghetti code
    In 2000, someone??? came up with the idea of REST calls
    Stateless - hope was that it would be faster and more reliable
    Used for data transfer (way to get/send data)
    Uses directory structure API
        GET /report/{id}
    Uses HTTP protocol & HTTP request methods (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE)

Connection pools in PostgreSQL
    Default connection pool size is 100
    System always reserves 3 for admin/CLI use
    So there are (n-3) available for users
    There is a view called pg_stat_activity that displays current connections
    See # of max connections in pgsql db:
        unix> grep max_connection /varl/lib/pgsql/9.5/data/postgresql.conf
    How many connections are in use now?
        pgsql> select usename, count(usename) from pg_stat_activity group by usename;
    Hikari has connection config in application.yaml
Connection pools (app-side): Hikari, Tomcat_CP, C3P0, SimpleDriverDataSource, SingleConnectionDataSource...
Postgres: If you exceed the number of available connections, the app will crash.
    Increase number of connections as necessary (or until you run out of RAM)
Elastic: Push it until it breaks, then step back a little
