Lessons:
1. Version column in SQL table is useful for the "lunch problem", check is submitted form version >= current DB version
2.  SQL statements:

    Get which columns?  select *
    From what table?    from indicators
    With what filters?  where ind_type=1
    Sort how?           order by asc
    How many results?   limit 20 offset 21;

    Joins:
        Get which columns? Call vars what?              select r.id as report_id, r.display_name, i.id as indicator_id, i.value
        From what table?                                from reports r
        Join with what? With what equality?             join link_reports_indicators lri on (r.id=lri.report)
        Join with what? With what equality?             join indicator i on (lri.indicator=i.id);
