Lessons

1. SQL where clause : used for filtering a dataset
       where filtering: ilike, between, is, is not, <, >, <=, >=, =
       Wildcard: %

2. Client side vs server side pagination:
    When you want to display a grid, which machine handles displaying/filtering results?
    Client side: REST endpoint passes back all results (the whole dataset) and user's machine must render and sdisplay
                    Pros: GG2EZ - simple to implement
                          Works for a small amount of records
                    Cons: Does not scale up
    Server side: Server only passes a certain pagesize back
                    Pros: Scalable
                          Fast
                    Cons: Server must handl filters, handle SQL where clause or ES query and send list of DTOs back
