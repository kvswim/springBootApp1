Selecting the newest/oldest date from a table

---Traditional SQL style
select oldest.id, r.display_name, oldest.created_date, newest.last_modified_date
from
    (
        select distinct on (id) id, timestamp as created_date
        from reports_aud
        order by id, timestamp asc
    ) oldest
join
    (
        select distinct on (id) id, timestamp as last_modified_date
        from reports_aud
        order by id, timestamp desc
    ) newest on (oldest.id = newest.id)
join
        reports r on (r.id = oldest.id);

---CTE style (Common Table Expression)
with oldest as
    (
        select distinct on (id) id, timestamp as created_date
        from reports_aud
        order by id, timestamp asc
    ),
     newest as
         (
             select distinct on (id) id, timestamp as last_modified_date
             from reports_aud
             order by id, timestamp desc
         )
select r.id, r.display_name, oldest.created_date, newest.last_modified_date
from oldest
    join newest on (oldest.id = newest.id)
    join reports r on (oldest.id = r.id)
order by r.id;
