SQL

1. Join types: left, right, inner (regular), full

2. Case statements:                         select s.sell_date,
                     if                     case when u.full_name is null
                     then/else                      then 'unknown' else u.full_name
                     close if                       end as FullName,
                                                    s.value
                                             from sales s
                                             full join users u on u.id = s.salesperson_id;
    Bad practice to cast something in a column, better to make a new column if really req'd

3. Before making a REST endpoint,
        get the contract
        Verify the data exists
